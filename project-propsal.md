# Project 3
**Group:** John Goodale, Julia Smith, Julia Sweet, Kyle Younghans, Matt Garcia and Ricardo Bonner

**Topic:** 2018 Home and Away Team Success Analysis

**Question:** Do home teams perform better then away teams?

**Objective:** Develop a map showing all NFL stadiums, by location; by clicking on each stadium be able to obtain general stats relative to that particular stadium. Also, show general stats by team and for the entire NFL in 2018.
As of now, we are hoping to create a Heroku app that will allow users to explore and visualize the data. We would like to have a Leaflet map that will show the locations of all stadiums with tooltips providing home vs away statics. Additionally we will display home vs away performance statistics as aggrigated across the entire NFL.<br>
**Possible stats to show:** Home and away win percentage, TD converted home vs away, field goal attempted home vs away, field goal converted home vs away, percentage of FG conversion, punts, 4th down conversions.
